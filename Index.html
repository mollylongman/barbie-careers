  <h2 style="color:#ef26d1">Barbie's Most Common Careers (1959 to 2023)</h2>
   <p> text here </p>Hello, this project is looking into all the many dope careers Barbie's had between 1959 and today. She really is a very busy lady. The intention here is to show what her most frequent careers were (so, for example, how many years was Barbie a professional cheerleader!? The answer is 10, from 1963 to 1964 and, after a nearly 30-year hiatus, again in 1992, 2000, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014… I’m confident her basket toss was flawless that entire time).

   I also looked into the average median salary for some of her most frequent careers. Being an astronaut was her top earning job of her frequent careers, with an average base salary of $239,986 U.S. dollars in 2023. If you’re looking for a fun fact to repeat as you walk into the Barbie movie next month, you can tell your friends that Barbie actually went to the moon, in 1965, four years before Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong got there in 1969. Honestly this is a huge historical oversight. Someone should tell Elon Musk to get Barbie on the team over at SpaceX (on second thought, maybe don’t tell him, lest he destroy our dear Barbie as he has Twitter). 

  
    In a possible future continuation of this project, I hope to interview a Barbie historian who may be able to weigh in on how gender roles factored into the jobs Barbie did, especially earlier on in her career. And, how did the jobs Barbie did impact our psyches — did Barbie influence what we believed we could do (or couldn’t do?).
  
  Other notable careers Barbie has had in her long, shiny, and storied life: panda rescuer, food truck operator, saxophonist, and SeaWorld trainer (she worked this last gig in 2013, the same year Blackfish came out... not sure if she was in her "nefarious era" or what. But, to be fair, she was also working as astronaut, babysitter, and Canadian Mountie during that same year, which is frankly a lot of emotional labor when you add it all up. So, perhaps she didn't have time to keep tabs on and report all the abuses occuring right under her nose to her HR department.)
