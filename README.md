<h1>Barbie Careers Project</h1>

In this project, I initially aimed to analyze Barbie’s many careers throughout the years. I was able to find a timeline on Wikipedia that was pretty complete, and I cross checked it against links from Mattel and BarbieDB.com. I then used pandas to figure out what her most common careers were that she worked multiple years over the years. 

I found her most frequent career by far was “fashion model,” a job she did for 23 years of her life between 1959 and 2023. I used pandas to figure out the top 10-15 careers, but I realized late in the game that if I wanted to be totally accurate in the “most frequent” careers, I would have needed to include all the ties for 10 and not just the top 10 things that came up in pandas. However, I am leaving it for now. 

I also found it interesting to look up the average median salaries for the top 15 most frequent jobs she had, which, again, I discovered using Pandas. I used Salary.com and a spreadsheet mostly to figure this out, though there were a few numbers for figure skater and cheerleader that seemed strangely high, so I went with other websites that seemed more accurate to the internet census. If I went back, I’d probably go try to find more reliable data sources for salaries, like perhaps the Labor bureau? 

Then I put it all in datawrapper, which was fun to play with. I was able to make it pink, with was sick. 

I really did learn a lot during this project. I got to try out my new Pandas skills, and learn to use Datawrapper for the first time. I also set my first life project up on Github and experimented with html. There’s still a lot I’d like to do to beautify it through tools like Bulma, but I didn’t have time to get that far. Next time. 

<h2>Things I’d do differently next time: </h2>

In my second bar chart, I’m beginning to think I should have done the same kind of bar chart as I did the first time, as it was easier to see the numbers, but I wanted to mix it up and the stripes were pretty. 
 Meanwhile, I was hoping to do a lot more with the data. Like, I thought it’d be cool to figure out the median salary for all the jobs she’s done over the years and figure out how rich she’d be.

I also found a Barbie historian and author who I tried to get on the phone, but she couldn’t chat before the deadline unfortunately. I’d still love to pick her brain though, as I think it’d be interesting to do future graphs or analysis on how gender roles informed her careers, and what percentage of Barbie’s careers are traditional “pink collar” or “women dominated” careers vs. “men dominated” ones. Since multiple generations of young people have grown up playing with Barbies, I’d love to see an analysis on how these careers informed what we all believed we could do when we grew up. 

So more charts like that could be cool! Maybe pie charts on “types” of jobs” 

And then a career total $ section absolutely would have been sick. Maybe that could have been a line chart? 

<h2>Some skills I’d have liked to have practiced more: </h2>

I tried briefly to “steal” a website design and use bulma and other html tools, but it was taking a long time and not really working that well for me, so I spent more time doing the data wrapper charts and analysis and description (and just figuring out how to set this live on GitHub, with assists from Soma and Gordon!).
